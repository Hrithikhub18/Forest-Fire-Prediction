# Forest Fire Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project predicts whether a forest fire occurs based on environmental and weather features. It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and classification using a Random Forest model. The project helps understand patterns in forest fires and their correlation with climate and environmental variables.

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis with barplots, boxplots, and heatmaps
- Feature encoding for categorical variables (month, day)
- Random Forest classification model
- Evaluation with accuracy and classification report

## Files in this Repository
- `forest_fire_prediction.ipynb` — Main Jupyter Notebook with all code
- `forestfires.csv` — Dataset used for training and testing

## How to Run
1. Ensure Python and Jupyter Notebook are installed.
2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
